# Multipass Authentication

## Describe the bug for MACOS

When trying to use multipass in any way on my MAC, for example:

```
[Insert your command here]
```

I get the following output:

```
[Insert output here]
```

Then trying

```
[Insert command here]
```

results in:

```
[Insert result here]
```

results in

```
[Insert result here]
```

To solve this, I first looked for the path of the file “multipass“ on my command line:

```
[Insert command here]
```

Then I deleted multipass related folders using:

```
[Insert command here]
```

Next, I uninstalled multipass:

```
[Insert command here]
```

Then I installed it back:

```
[Insert command here]
```

Now I could do:

```
[Insert command here]
```

I was able to run this command, thus authentication bug solved.
